# CSVScoresToExcel
This is a small application that generates spreadsheets for a sports club. The outputs are intended to be viewed by members to see how they are doing. 

There is a system in place already to keep track of scores, which includes the ability to scores to .csv format. Currently, heads of sections must do a manual process of data cleaning and copying into spreadsheets which is time consuming, and as a result often delayed because time has not been found to do it.

Hopefully this should speed things up.
